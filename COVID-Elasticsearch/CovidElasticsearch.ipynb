Our aim was to define, through a mutational analysis, regions of HIV-1 IRES that are important for its activity. A dual-luciferase reporter construct where the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) translation is cap-dependent while the firefly luciferase (Fluc) translation depends on HIV-1 IRES was used. The Fluc/Rluc ratio was measured in lysates of Jurkat T cells transfected with the dual-luciferase plasmid bearing either the wild-type or a mutated IRES. Deletions or mutations in three regions decreased the IRES activity but deletion or mutations of a stem-loop preceding the primer binding site increased the IRES activity. The wild-type IRES activity, but not that of an IRES with a mutated stem-loop, was increased when cells were treated with agents that induce oxidative stress. Such stress is known to be caused by HIV-1 infection and we propose that this stem-loop is involved in a switch that stimulates the IRES activity in cells infected with HIV-1, supporting the suggestion that the IRES activity is up-regulated in the course of HIV-1 replication cycle.\",2010-10-08,\"Gendron, Karine; Ferbeyre, Gerardo; Heveker, Nikolaus; Brakier-Gingras, Léa\",Nucleic Acids Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/54e77bff1912076bccf12a6b099e48a59f634d5f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/21337e54a7d02b12aea5f5835648d69aef32701e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3035469.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3035469/,\\r',\n",

       "     'abstract': 'Initiation of translation of the full-length messenger RNA of HIV-1, which generates the viral structural proteins and enzymes, is cap-dependent but can also use an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 5′ untranslated region. Our aim was to define, through a mutational analysis, regions of HIV-1 IRES that are important for its activity. A dual-luciferase reporter construct where the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) translation is cap-dependent while the firefly luciferase (Fluc) translation depends on HIV-1 IRES was used. The Fluc/Rluc ratio was measured in lysates of Jurkat T cells transfected with the dual-luciferase plasmid bearing either the wild-type or a mutated IRES. Deletions or mutations in three regions decreased the IRES activity but deletion or mutations of a stem-loop preceding the primer binding site increased the IRES activity. The wild-type IRES activity, but not that of an IRES with a mutated stem-loop, was increased when cells were treated with agents that induce oxidative stress. Such stress is known to be caused by HIV-1 infection and we propose that this stem-loop is involved in a switch that stimulates the IRES activity in cells infected with HIV-1, supporting the suggestion that the IRES activity is up-regulated in the course of HIV-1 replication cycle.',\n",

In human H1N1 viruses that circulated in the first years of the 21st century, this mutation carried a fitness cost and resistant viruses were rare. During the 2007–08 influenza season, oseltamivir-resistant viruses of H1N1 phenotype emerged and predominated. March 2009 saw the emergence of a novel H1N1 influenza pandemic. We examined whether the H275Y mutation affected neuraminidase enzyme activity or replication of the pandemic influenza virus. METHODS: Using reverse genetics we engineered the H275Y mutation into the neuraminidase of a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and assessed the ability of this enzyme to desialylate mono- and multivalent substrates. The growth kinetics of wild-type and mutant viruses were assessed in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and fully differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. RESULTS: The presence of H275Y was associated with a 1.3-fold decrease in the affinity of the neuraminidase for a monovalent substrate and a 4-fold compromise in desialylation of multivalent substrate. This was associated with a fitness cost to viral replication in vitro, which only became apparent during competitive replication in the mucus-rich HAE culture system. CONCLUSIONS: The neuraminidase protein of pandemic influenza isolates tolerates the H275Y mutation and this mutation confers resistance to oseltamivir.

In a sepsis simulation model, we tested whether the anesthetic ketamine inhibits the macrophage TNF response to antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA bacteria via its antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated for 18 hrs with 10(5 )to 10(7 )CFU/mL inocula of either of two prototypical CA-MRSA isolates, USA300 strain LAC and USA400 strain MW2, in the presence of either vancomycin or daptomycin. One hour before bacterial stimulation, ketamine was added with or without MK-801 (dizocilpine, a chemically unrelated non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), APV (D-2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), NMDA, or combinations of these agents. Supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF concentration by ELISA. RESULTS: RAW264.7 cells exposed to either LAC or MW2 in the presence of daptomycin secreted less TNF than in the presence of vancomycin. The addition of ketamine inhibited macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the CA-MRSA isolates (LAC, MW2) in the presence of either antibiotic. The NMDA inhibitors, MK-801 and APV, also suppressed macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA isolates, and the effect was not additive or synergistic with ketamine. The addition of NMDA substrate augmented TNF secretion in response to the CA-MRSA bacteria, and the addition of APV suppressed the effect of NMDA in a dose-dependent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine inhibits TNF secretion by MRSA-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and the mechanism likely involves NMDA receptor antagonism.

In a sepsis simulation model, we tested whether the anesthetic ketamine inhibits the macrophage TNF response to antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA bacteria via its antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated for 18 hrs with 10(5 )to 10(7 )CFU/mL inocula of either of two prototypical CA-MRSA isolates, USA300 strain LAC and USA400 strain MW2, in the presence of either vancomycin or daptomycin. One hour before bacterial stimulation, ketamine was added with or without MK-801 (dizocilpine, a chemically unrelated non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), APV (D-2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), NMDA, or combinations of these agents. Supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF concentration by ELISA. RESULTS: RAW264.7 cells exposed to either LAC or MW2 in the presence of daptomycin secreted less TNF than in the presence of vancomycin. The addition of ketamine inhibited macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the CA-MRSA isolates (LAC, MW2) in the presence of either antibiotic. The NMDA inhibitors, MK-801 and APV, also suppressed macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA isolates, and the effect was not additive or synergistic with ketamine. The addition of NMDA substrate augmented TNF secretion in response to the CA-MRSA bacteria, and the addition of APV suppressed the effect of NMDA in a dose-dependent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine inhibits TNF secretion by MRSA-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and the mechanism likely involves NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings may have therapeutic significance in MRSA sepsis.',\n",

In addition, APOM gene function was further characterized to elucidate its activity in cholesterol metabolism. Seventeen APOM SNPs documented in the NCBI database were genotyped. Five SNPs were confirmed in our study cohort of 1234 T2D and 606 control participants. Three of the five SNPs rs707921(C+1871A), rs707922(G+1837T) and rs805264(G+203A) were in linkage disequilibrium (LD). We chose rs707922 to tag this LD region for down stream association analyses and characterized the function of this SNP at molecular level. No association between APOM and T2D susceptibility was detected in our Hong Kong Chinese cohort. Interestingly, the C allele of rs805297 was significantly associated with T2D duration of longer than 10 years (OR = 1.245, p = 0.015). The rs707922 TT genotype was significantly associated with elevated plasma total- and LDL- cholesterol levels (p = 0.006 and p = 0.009, respectively) in T2D patients. Molecular analyses of rs707922 lead to the discoveries of a novel transcript APOM5 as well as the cryptic nature of exon 5 of the gene. Ectopic expression of APOM5 transcript confirmed rs707922 allele-dependent activity of the transcript in modifying cholesterol homeostasis in vitro. In conclusion, the results here did not support APOM as a T2D susceptibility gene in Hong Kong Chinese.
